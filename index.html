      <blockquote>PSSL is a long-running series of informal gatherings covering all aspects of category theory and its applications, typically held over a weekend at a university in Europe. The first PSSL was held in Oxford, in May 1976. This is the 111th PSSL, following meetings in Tallinn, Leiden, Terrasini, and Athens.</blockquote>
